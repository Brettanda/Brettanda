### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Brett Anda

I am an aspiring web developer that took the course New Media Production and Design at SAIT who's always looking for a new technology to learn! 

I have experience with WordPress, Vue.js, Vagrant, Webpack, Ubuntu, and more.

My two current projects that I am working on are a Discord bot that I have named [Friday](https://github.com/Brettanda/friday-discord-node.js) and a website with articles to help web developers with the same issues that I ran into when I am learning about web development called [Developer Bacon](https://developerbacon.ca).
